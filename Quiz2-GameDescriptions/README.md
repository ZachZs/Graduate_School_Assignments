# Quiz2-GameDescriptions

This program was a quiz assignment I had while in graduate school. The basic premise was to examine word frequencies in mobile game reviews from Apple. This quiz was done prior to our learning of natural language processing, so the break down of word frequencies was done for us.

Th file descriptions are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><em>Apple1000Games.csv</em>: This .csv contains the word frequencies from the 1000 games that we used on the assignment. Each row corresponds to a game, and each column is a word.</li>
  <li><em>apple1000new.csv</em>: This .csv has the original data set before the word frequencies were generated.</li>
  <li><em>Quiz_2_Apple_Game_Descriptions.ipynb</em>: This is the actual notebook with the code that I wrote. Most of the code is to run dimension reduction and algorithm variations on the word frequencies</li>
</ul>
