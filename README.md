# Graduate_School_Assignments

This is a folder of some of the projects I completed while in my graduate program. As such, they are fairly rough and are only uploaded as an indication of progress through my learning process. I believe there is merit to having older code examples, even if they are not the best representations of my abilities. Everyone's journey to learn data science starts out in a place of weakness, and it is only through practice that we can get better.

Summary of the files:
<ul>
  <li><em>KNN-NaiveBayes-Quiz</em>: This folder contains an early assignment where we learned about early classification.</li>
  <li><em>LendingClubAnalysis</em>: This quiz was an assignment to look at clustering and evaluating data, as well as writing a report.</li>
  <li><em>Quiz2-GameDescriptions</em>: This quiz was an introduction into natural language processing for us, and we used several methods to try and examine descriptions of mobile games.</li>
  <li><em>RWebScraping</em>: This was a small assignment to introduce us to web-scraping in R. I included it since it became the basis for a personal project of mine involving <a href="https://github.com/ZachZs/PersonalMovieData">movies</a> .</li>
</ul>
